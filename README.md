# Akka HTTP Bookstore API

This repo contains the project for the book [Akka HTTP RESTful APIs](http://bit.ly/leanpub-akka-book).

You'll find a branch for each chapter the book has.

With the book you'll learn:

- How to set up database migrations using Flyway.
- Build our own directives and using them in the routing DSL.
- Authenticate users using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Test our services using ScalaTest.
- Build a UI for searching books with Scalatags.
- Connecting to a currency API to allow the user to switch currencies when the books are displayed.
- All by using a Test-driven development (TDD) approach.

And more!
